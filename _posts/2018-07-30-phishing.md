The quality of some attempted phishing e-mails are questionable. They are incredibly obvious and many people will wonder who would *possibly* fall for it. 

This final e-mail is generally the only insight people get into a phishing attack, and maybe some statistics from the security team if they are feeling generous. So, it is understandable that people will have questions around the attacks being launched by security teams

This post will take you through the design and development of a phishing fire drill at Sky Betting & Gaming and answer some of those questions.

## Step 1: Identify what you are testing
The first step in a phishing exercise is to identify what you are trying to test. Often, this gets missed and people launch into designing a shiny looking e-mail. It's understandable, most of us would assume that we are testing people who are receiving the e-mail, but that's not always true.

A phishing fire drill could test:
* Technical controls that are in place to prevent individuals receieving the e-mail.
* Technical controls that are in place to prevent individuals responding to the e-mail.
* The incident response process.
* An entire organisation
* A specific job role, person or other subset of people.
* Propensity to click a link/open a file.
* Propensity to enter confidential details.
* Propensity to respond to the e-mail.

Without knowing what or who you are planning to test, you will end up with a generic e-mail send that most people will pick up on and you will be left with a false sense of achievement.

The primary focus for this phishing exercise was the incident response process across the entire organisation. But we also collected details on click through rates as a secondary focus.

## Step 2: Build a scenario

We know what we want to test, the incident response process and the entire organisation. Now we need to build that into a scenario to provide further focus.

The scenario developed was as follows:

> E-mail addresses of all employees have been leaked and are being used as part of a targeted phishing attack against the company. The security operations centre are not aware of the leaked addresses at this point in time. The threat actor is only interested in launching a low skill, low effort attack and will not be spending much time on the attempted phish. They are attempting a scattergun approach by hitting as many people as possible.

## Step 3: Obtain addresses

For this exercise, we skipped this step. 

The scenario was based on addresses being leaked so we just used internal resources to generate the list of addresses. 

Another common scenario we use is based on targetting those staff with a publicly available e-mail address, or in a certain job role. We could have simulated the attacker obtaining e-mail addresses publically using OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), think hunting Linkedin, Facebook & Twitter, for their details.

It is more time consuming, but can hit home for some people on why it is important to keep details private.

## Step 4: Designing the Phish
